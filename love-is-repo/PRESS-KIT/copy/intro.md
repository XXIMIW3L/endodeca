# Intro 

A nocturne built for wakefulness: a field of stars becomes procedure, not backdrop. Tuned to **432 Hz** and composed to uplift and energize. *love is* treats desire as aerodynamics—pull, lift, glide—measured against the hush of a real sky. 

PreSonus Studio One shaped the audio; DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, and Procreate refined the picture; captured on Apple iPhone. The piece doesn’t argue. It calibrates. When the frame settles, the viewer rises.

Endodeca houses releases by MAXXIMILLIAN with the rigor of a catalogue raisonné—documents first, spectacle second. Everything you need to present, credit, and verify the work lives here.
